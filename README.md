# Finance-Project

In this data project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. 


We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) all the way to early 2016.

## Getting the Data

Here we will use pandas to directly read data from Google finance using pandas!

First we need to start with the proper imports.

*Note: [You'll need to install pandas-datareader for this to work!](https://github.com/pydata/pandas-datareader) Pandas datareader allows you to [read stock information directly from the internet](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/remote_data.html) Use these links for install guidance (**pip install pandas-datareader**), or just follow along with the video lecture.*
